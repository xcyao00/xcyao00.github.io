This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

About Me
======
Hello! I'm Xincheng Yao (姚欣成), a Ph.D. student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I'm working under the guidance of [Prof. Chongyang Zhang](https://faculty.sjtu.edu.cn/zhangchongyang/zh_CN/index.htm). My academic interests are about **Computer Vision** and **Anomaly Detection**, with a specific focus on **Image Anomaly Detection**. Recently, my research has mainly been centered on how to design more general anomaly detection models, such as Zero/Few-shot and Class-Generalizable Anomaly Detection, and the application of large vision language models in anomaly detection tasks.

If you find my research intriguing, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me by my email **i-dover@sjtu.edu.cn**. I welcome any inquries or discussions regarding my work! :blush:
